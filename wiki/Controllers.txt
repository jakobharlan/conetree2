The are multiple Controllers that provide interaction posibilities with the Conetree

### Key Controller
This Controller provides keyboard controls for the Conetree.

**Keybindings**

+ Up - focus parent node
+ Left / KeyRight - select an edge/ node to continue exploring
+ Down - switch the focus to down the selected edge

+ C - collapse subtree of focus node
+ X - switch colormode (nodetype/ depth)
+ P - print the conetree structure for debugging

+ F1 - turn all controlls on/ off


1. create a KeyController instance
2. call myConstructor and pass a conetree instance as the argument

```
import Controller.KeyController

conetree_keycontroller = KeyController()
conetree_keycontroller.myConstructor(conetree)
```




### Pick Controller
This Controller provides ray controls for the conetree

Its was created to be used with a tracked pointer device that controls the ray.

When this controller is used, the edge to the node closes to the ray is highlighted.  
When the ray points quite far to the right or left, the Subtree of the focused node is rotated accordingly. 
With a quick down/ up movement it is possible to switch the focus to the selected child or the parent node.


1. create a PickController instance
2. call myConstructor and pass a conetree instance
3. set or connect the ray field of the Controller


```
import Controller.PickController

conetree_pickcontroller = PickController()
conetree_pickcontroller.myConstructor(conetree)
conetree_pickcontroller.Ray.value = pick_ray

```
